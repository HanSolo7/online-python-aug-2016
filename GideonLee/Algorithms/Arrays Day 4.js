// Arrays Day 4

// Skyline Heights
// From lovely Burbank you have a breathtaking view of the 
// Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say you are given an array with 
// heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you 
// and extending directly away. Array [-1,7,3] would represent 
// three buildings: first is actually out of view below street 
// level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 
// stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated 
// at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings
//  you can see, in order. Given [1,-1,7,3] return [1,7].

// Filter Range
// Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One tool is to eliminate
// numbers he knows are outside a certain specific range. Given
// array and values min and max, remove array values between min 
// and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with 
// values in original order. No built-in array functions.
