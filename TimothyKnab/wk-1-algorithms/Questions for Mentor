1. Arrays day 2:
	Remove Duplicates -- (python) How can I remove the set() from output?
	The proper usage of set()?



2. Arrays day 1 / day 3:
	
	(Day 2) Remove At

	(Day 3) Array Min To Front
	Given this for loop in JS:

			 for (var i = idx; i < arr.length; i += 1) { 
			 		// do something
			 }


			 can this also be written as,

			 for ( var i = idx; i < arr.length; i++ ) {
			 		// do something
			 }


			 as well as 'i -= 1'	written as 		'i--' ?


3. General Python Question:
	':' and '::'  -- how are these used to assess a list? 
	I'm a little confused on how exactly we can use these...
